  schedule:
    - cron:  '28 */12 * * *'
    # This runs at minute 28 past every 12th hour.
    # You can change the schedule by adding a new value. Try https://crontab.guru for the right syntax
    # e.g. '0 10 * * 5-6' if you want to register only for saturdays and sundays 
    # * is a special character in YAML, so you have to quote this string
